##### 
**Progress**: More Free code camp's responsive web design w/ Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** Things are going fine but I can't wait to see the end product of all this. 


### Day 16 : July 21  , 2017 
##### 
**Progress**: Still on Free Code Camp's responsive web design Â w/ Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** The whole idea of resonsive web design is getting clearer for me. But still trying to figure out bootstrap code statements one challenge at a time. Maybe by the end of the section, everything will come together.

### Day 15 : July 20  , 2017 
##### 
**Progress**: Back on free code camp, learning responsive design using bootstrap. 

**Thoughts:** I think I will be here for some time. Bootstrap is new to me but so far its going good. 

### Day 14 : July 19  , 2017 
##### 
**Progress**: Continued Colt's Web devp Bootcamp tutorial on Udemy. Worked on creating a Pokemon reference table using HTML. Also created my first pen. 

**Thoughts:** It was a lovely yet simple tutorial. The best part today was getting to code on Codepen. Now I have a link to finally add to my journal. YAY!

### Day 13 : July 18  , 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**:  Completed FCC's HTML and CSS section. I also sat down and planned a road map using an article I read from Jonathan Z White's medium post.

**Thoughts:**  I feel like I accomplished something. Finishing a section gave me motivation that I was moving forward. I might be slow and missing days at times but I was still staying committed. Also, having a road map makes things even more clearer and motivating. Now I have a new perspective on what to accomplish each and every day. It's alot but with the right mindset, I can do it one day at a time.

##### 

**Today's Progress**: 1) Finally completed Problem set 3 (optional) on Udacity's Intro to Comp Science (Python). 
2) Also, a lot of progress with FreeCodeCamp 's challenges. Here is a quick list on what I coverd in today's challenges: 
-> Working with Divs
-> Using ID attributes + Styling ID attributes 
-> Learnt how to customize padding, margin and  border of an element 
-> CSS Inheritance & Overiding CSS elements + ID precedency in CSS Styling. 

**Thoughts:** I feel really good today. I had a lot of tasks to chew on today (including non coding related) and I made sure I worked on some coding first and eventually got the non coding tasks done as well. Feeling accomplished!!

### Day 10: July 8 , 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Forked 100DaysofCode repo on Github, Updated today's progress on it, Worked on FreeCodeCamp excercises.

**Thoughts:** I still have so much to learn on using Github and Git. So overwhelming but I can do this. FreeCodeCamp is going fine (so far I have learnt how to linking images, creating border for an image, creating forms, inputs and buttons for the forms,lists. I can see the cat photo app tutorial coming on fine. I can't wait to create my own version from scratch on codepen!
