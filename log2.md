### Day 21   : 11th Oct 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Continued with Colt Steele's Web Devp Bootcamp on Udemy - still on Bootstrap section. 

**Thoughts:** Airtel network was really bad today for video streaming so I just managed to watch few of the bootstrap tutorials. I hope it will be much better tomorrow. Can't wait to start applying Bootstrap on Colt's assignments. I've also started preparing a time table for studying Andela's Home study curriculum 

### Day 17 - 20  : 7th - 10th Oct 2017 
##### 
**Progress**: I didn't get the time to actually code anything, I was out of town w/o my laptop but I watched Colt Steele's Boostrap Tutorials videos and read coding posts on medium just to keep myself from zoning out of the coding atmosphere I have created. 

**Thoughts:** I missed tapping my fingers on my laptop. But I will be back on track soon 

### Day 12 - 16   : 3rd - 6th Oct 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Completed another CSS Box Model exercise, this time it was a mini news blogsite.  I have also started some introduction to Bootstrap framework.

**Thoughts:** The mini news blogsite was challenging but I didn't give up. It took couple of days but I think it looks good. The challenge gave me a good practice on using chrome inspector to figure out how to set the properties of my elements which would otherwise be so difficult. I love the chrome inspector!!
