## Day 100: 29th Dec 2017
#####
 
 **Progress** Worked on the color project. Really tried to get it over with before the clocked striked 12 am but I couldn't. I have the styling left. Most of the logic works so I guess I am good. 
 
 **Thoughts** I am so happy I made it to the 100th Day!! And I am totally going for round two. There are somethings I would like to do before starting off with that though. I also hope to write a post on My take of 100 Days of Code, I really hope I end up publishing it on medium. But I will celebrate the fact that I pulled it through regardless and completed the 100 Days of Code Challenge - Round 1.

## Day 90 & 91: 19th & 20th Dec 2017
##### 

**Progress** Worked on my Color Game project. I have been given an assignment that required me to finish Codecademy's HTML course (Assignment given at the Nigerian Women Techsters Training program), so I worked on that too. 

## Day 86, 87, 88 &  89: 15th, 16th, 17th & 18th Dec 2017
##### 

**Progress** 
 - 15th Dec: More pages read from MDN Javascript and Eloquent JS.
- 16th Dec: Attended Ibadan's first Python Meetup, I networked while learning more about Python Fundamentals, Learnt the basics of building a web app using Flask web framwork, I had an enlightening listen to alot of possibilities that could come from Internet of Things.
- 17th Dec: Started a 'Color Game' project that will round up my skills so far in HTML,CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.
- 18th Dec: Didn't work much as initially planned. Listened to Free code camp podcasts titled "Which progrmming language should you learn first" ,although I have already chosen mine, I like that this podcast offers projects to work on while learning (that's exactly what caught my attention).

**Thoughts** I warned myself about not logging my coding activities this way but I really wasn't able to log in the last three days. I am nearing 100 days and I should have got used to logging daily by now. I really should. 


## Day 85: 14th Dec 2017
##### 

**Progress** More of MDN Javascript and Eleqouent JS. 

**Thoughts** Today was one of those "I am not sure coding is for me" days. Feel so overwhelmed trying to keeping up with everything on my schedule. Sigh. 


## Day 83 & 84: 12th  & 13th Dec 2017
##### 

**Progress** MDN's JS guide ( trying to grasp the concept of closures) and Eloquent Javascript (2nd Edition)    


## Day 81 & 82: 10th  & 11th Dec 2017
##### 

**Progress** Refactored the African Wildlife Project on GitHub and added comments to more projects uploaded.  

## Day 80: 9th Dec 2017
##### 

**Progress** I read few tutorials on good code commenting and I have started adding comments to projects uploaded on GitHub to reflect on what I have read. I also attended the Nigerian Women Techsters' first class (introductory) of 12 classes that will be training 200 women in web and mobile applications, Game Development and Embedded systems. I opted for web ofcourse. 

## Day 78 & 79: 7th & 8th Dec 2017
##### 

**Progress** Covered some more topics on Distilled Computer Science book (precisely on Boolean Algebra and logic behind truth tables). Covered a Github tutorial on creating a git repository using the bash command line and connecting the local repository to it's online version available on github.com. I also covered a tutorial on code commenting/ documentation of projects on GitHub. 

**Thoughts** I realized I didn't do a good job not commenting on the coding exercises/projects or repositories that I have uploaded on GitHub lately and how amateur that would make me look (not denying I am an amateur anyway), so I decided to read some resources on how to provide useful comments to my codes on Github that will not just allow me to understand what the code does but also make it easy for others to find out too. I should point out that I've learnt that commit messages should always be in present tense because we may choose to revert to an earlier state. Hence from now, I will be leaving my commit messages in the present tense. 

## Day 77: 6th Dec 2017
##### 

**Progress** Read MDN's JS guide. Learnt about Maps. Also continuedd to read distilled computer science book.

## Day 76: 5th Dec 2017
##### 

**Progress** I uploaded projects on Github that  I have worked on so far during this coding journey. Read a distilled Computer Science book by Wladston Ferreira Filho. 

**Thoughts** The aim behind reading this book is to refresh some concepts that will be useful for me while coding. I have come across some of these concepts during my I.T degree and I could really use some refreshing

## Day 75: 4th Dec 2017
##### 

**Progress** Uploaded another exercise I have recently done on Github. I rewrote the code myself again and I am glad I did.  

**Thoughts** While doing this exercise, I made mistakes which I think has taught me quite a few lessons. Who says you have to be building a huge project before you learn something. 

One such lesson learnt from this exercise: 

*Selecting an element using querySelector works safer than selecting elements using getElementsByClassName.* : This simple information caused me 3 hours of debugging. It totally skipped my mind that using a 'getElementsByClassName' returns a list of elements if not used in a certain format that allows you to specify the index of the element to be returned << eg: btn.getElementsByClassName('button')[1] >>. I selected by element using 'getElementsByClassName'  and ended up with an error message similar to  *variable.addEventListener  is not a function*. On subsequently googling it, I understood that its better to use 'querySelector' which is straight to point and returns just one element. Rather than using 'getElementsByClassName' which return a whole list. 

## Day 72, 73 & 74: 1st, 2nd & 3rd Dec 2017
##### 

**Progress** Brushing up on  JS topics covered so far by going through Eloquent Javascript, JS book written by Marijn Haverbeke. I am not done with it yet though.

**Thoughts** Honestly been tied up with my big brother coming to Nigeria for a visit. However, because I want to stay consistent and not lose my 74 Days streak, I am occupying  my coding hour with reading Eloquent JS. Before starting any video tutorials on JS or even starting Â the Web developer bootcamp with Colt on Udemy, I read few pages of Eloquent JS and felt really bored and eventually had to put it awsy . I am not sure why that  happened because now having covered upto JS events with Colt and now reading Eloquent JS, my opinion has changed entirely. Everything makes sense now!

## Day 70 & 71 : 29th & 30th Nov 2017
#####

**Progress** Completed Section 14 of WDB course with Colt. Done with Advanced DOM Manipulation. I will be moving on to working on  color project next. More on that tomorrow. 

## Day 68 & 69 : 27th & 28th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress** Completed the Score Keeper app and uploaded it on GitHub for the first time! Now I have another repository besides 100 Days of Code.   

**Thoughts** It feels good to see a new repository besides the usual 100 Days of Code. I am surely going to upload my other existing projects on GitHub.

## Day 66 & 67 : 25th & 26th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress** Colt Steele's WDB course - Section 14, video 157.

## Day 64 & 65: 23rd & 24th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress** Working on a Score keeper exercise combining  HTML, CSS and Javascript concepts. The score keeper keeps score of a game between two players and allows the players to choose the number of rounds required for a winner to emerge. Also spent good amount of time reading MDN's Javascript guide - currently on Indexed Collections!

**Thoughts** I hope at the end of this exercise, I will be able to wrap my head around starting a basic application using HTML, CSS and JS. Not much of styling is involved in this score keeper exercise but the aim is to nail the logic behind a basic score keeper application. 

## Day 63: 22nd Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress**  Covered two DOM manipulation tutorials on Colt's WDB course. I worked on creating a button, which when clicked toggles the background color of the page. 


## Day 60, 61 & 62: 19th, 20th & 21th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress**  I need good practice with event handling concept. These three days I practiced selecting different elements and executing code when an event takes place.

**Thoughts** Event handling is quite tricky. Syntax errors kept coming up with all those curly brackets and sqaure brackets.  

## Day 59: 18th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress** Back on the WDB course, completed the DOM Manipulation section. Had fun learning how to mess with Google's Landing page using Javascript. haha. Now I think I am ready for more advanced DOM concepts. 


## Day 57 & 58: 16th & 17th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress** Spent the two daysÂ reading MDN's comprehensive Javascript guide. I covered the basics and will get back to Colt's videos next.

## Day 56: 15th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress** Still on DOM Manipulation concepts. Covered Selectors today and I practiced using different ways to select elements from the page. Now that I can select, I will be learning to manipulate. 

## Day 54 & 55: 13th & 14th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress** Done with JS Objects and I have started with DOM Manipulation on WDB on Udemy. 

**Thoughts** Can't wait to revisit HTML and CSS with JavaScript again. Colt promised us with exciting vidoes to come. 

## Day 53: 12th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress** Gradually getting familiar with JS Objects. More progess done in WDB course. 4 more topics in this currect section and I will be moving to DOM Manipulation next.

**Thoughts** Retreiving complicated objects (objects with arrays or arrays with objects) can get pretty confusing. I need to master my way out of it. 


## Day 52: 11th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress** Finally done with Arrays! Now on JS Objects - Section 12, Lecture 134 of WDB course: Comparing Arrays and Objects in syntax. 

## Day 50 & 51: 9th & 10th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress** Rounding up Array concepts with Colt by testing my understanding with on Array problem sets. 

## Day 49: 8th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress**  Array Interation with Colt on WDB course.  

**thoughts** Going through some tough times but still managing to stay committed to everday coding and learning. I hope to get back to my initial progressing speed very soon.

## Day 47 & 48: 6th & 7th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress**  It was all about the Arrays on WDB course.  


## Day 45 & 46: 4th & 5th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress**  Almost done with Section 10 of Colt's Web developer bootcamp. Getting more practice with JS Functions. Next I will be moving to JS Arrays.
