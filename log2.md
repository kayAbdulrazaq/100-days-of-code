## Day 49: 8th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress**  Array Interation with Colt on WDB course.  

**thoughts** Going through some tough times but still managing to stay committed to everday coding and learning. I hope to get back to my initial progressing speed very soon.

## Day 47 & 48: 6th & 7th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress**  It was all about the Arrays on WDB course.  


## Day 45 & 46: 4th & 5th Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress**  Almost done with Section 10 of Colt's Web developer bootcamp. Getting more practice with JS Functions. Next I will be moving to JS Arrays.  


## Day 44: 3rd Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress** Practiced some JS functions.  
  

## Day 42: 1st Nov 2017
##### 

**Progress** Started JS Functions on WDB course. I didn't spend much time as expected -  network issues. For what it's worth, I did read some blog posts on responsive web design. 

**Thoughts:**  Having network issues sucks big time!

## Day 41: 31th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** Completed JS loops section on Colt's web developer bootcamp course. Successfully solved yesterday's while loop exercises using for loop. Moving on JS functions next.

**Thoughts:** For loop statements are way shorter than while loops! 

## Day 40: 30th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress**  Completed while loops section  of WDB and worked on 3 problem set to test my self. I did well with logic and syntax aspect of this problem set. Also started reading MDN's Javscript guide to take my understanding of JS concepts to another level. I was able to cover the introduction section today and tomorrow will be moving on to grammar types section of the docs. 

**Thoughts:** IT'S DAY FORTY! Happy and very much still motivated to succeed. I do get that feeling of "this might take ages to reach that web developer goal" but at the end of the day its what I have added to my knowledge that counts. If i stick to it everday, what I learn each day will  add to previous days' knowledge which means I am turning a new leaf each day. I should be proud of that and be patient. Slow and steady wins the race they say. 

## Day 39: 29th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** Completed Codecademy's JS ccourse today. Ended the course with jQuery. WDB is going great too - covered conditionals today - I had some practice with programming logic too. Next with  Colt is loops, That should be interesting. 

**Thoughts:** As i ended the Codecademy JS course, I felt the  jQuery concepts towards the end of course were quite shady with me so  I am glad I will get to go over those concepts  again with the WDB course so i am not too worried about it. I got the overview of what jQuery is about, learnt some tricks and I cant wait to go into it deeper with Colt. Completed a milestone with my prep for Andela Nigeria  Fellowship,I will still be on JS concepts to get a broader understanding of what was covered earlier and  add some more concepts to the basket.  I almost forgot to commit to github, that would have been depressing. So glad the alarm in me didn't allow my eyes to shut until I remembered what was yet to be done.

## Day 38 : 28th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** I got a dose of Jquery from Codecademy's JS course. It wasn't bad at all. I don't why I was getting anxious about jquery all this while. Now that I have started the course, it makes sense and I am starting to appreciate it more. Also did a bit of Colt Steel's WDB - I covered Section 8 which JS basics, now I am on section 9 unit 97 conditionals. 

**Thoughts:** I actually like that I am going through these concepts again with WDB (I worked with some of the topics on codecademy as well), it might seem redundant to some but to me its not, it gives me a broader understanding especially with Colt Steele's verbal explanations.


### Day 37 : 27th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** WDB Bootcamp with Colt, successfully nailed Colt's do it yourself exercises on JS. The exercises was about building an age calculator and a progam that prompted for name and printed out on the console, the full name of the person.

**Thoughts:** I really hope I continue to enjoy JS concepts because so far it's sweet and digestable. Nothing complicated yet.


### Day 36 : 26th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** Continued with Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course - covered JS primitives, variables and a little introduction to methods. Next coding session, I will be working on JS exercises to consolidate what I have covered so far on the course. Meanwhile on Andela Home Study Program , I am still on Codecademy JS courses. So far I have covered in brief: conditional statements, functions, scope concept in JS, JS Objects (Array). I will be learning about loops next on Codecademy. 

**Thoughts:**  I like that both WBD and Andela homestudy are focusing on JS concepts for now. I am slightly ahead with Codecademy but this serves as a light introduction to WDB's JS concepts. Going over the concepts again with Colt will really deepen my understanding. Moreover, the codecademy course I signed up for is the free subscription which doesn't include interactive lessons or freeform projects which are avalaible in upgraded version. 


### Day 35 : 25th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress**  Covered Javascript Functions today on Codecademy's Javascript course. 

**Thoughts:**  I am not very happy with my progress these two days, I need to put in more effort. 


### Day 34 : 24th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** Continued  with Codecademy's JS course. Moving on to functions next.

**Thoughts:**  I covered variables, datatypes, loops in JS today. Smooth stuff,

 
 ### Day 33  : 23rd Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** Started with Web Developer Bootcamp's Javascript section today. Still managing with a slow network so my progress isn't moving ahead as fast I thought it would.  

**Thoughts:**  Feeling good with JS so far. Javascript syntax seems pretty easy. A lot easier than Java syntax that I was taught in university. I hope I will continue to see it that way. Meanwhile on Andela homestudy progress - I have started Codecademy's JS course. So working with JS on udemy as well as codecademy. It will be interesting to see how fast I can grasp JS concepts. 


### Day 32  : 22nd Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** Rounded up Colt Steele Boostrap section by building a start up landing page. Next, I am moving on to Javascript. On Andela Home study progress, completed more than calculated - started of programming basics to refresh my memory. Tomorrow I will be doing some more revision with reading generally on programming syntax, data types, variables etc.  

**Thoughts:** The internet connection was still bad to day, videos just kept buffering. Atleast, I managed to complete a start up landing page. With this page done, I think I have consolidated Bootstrap basics and I am ready to move on to other things. Things like Javascript! - pretty excited to start off finally with this language. I hope I enjoy learning it tomorrow.

### Day 31  : 21st Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** I couldn't get it in as much coding as I planned for today, I wasn't feeling well and also the network was crappy again so streaming Tutorial videos was not successful either. I worked on my start up landing page. Not yet done with it but I really hope network would be better tomorrow plus I hope I would be feeling much better. I did a bit of studying Andela's homestudy curriculum as well. 

**Thoughts:** some days are better than others. It shouldn't make me feel so bad, I will just put it extra effort on the good days to compensate for the bad ones.

### Day 30  : 20th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** FINALLY DONE WITH MY AFRICAN WILDLIFE IMAGE GALLERY!! sorry that came out in caps but I am so happy I got through this. I have one more bootstrap grid project to work on but after all I went through with building this mini image gallery, I think I am more prepared to take on a bigger project. 

**Thoughts:** Oh my!, this mini image gallery using bootstrap grid system was packed with challenges but guess what, I made it through. After 2 days of battling and taking breaks in between, I finally got a breakthrough. Although I had a code along seesion of this mini image gallery during Colt's bootcamp tutorial, I decided to added few extra feature from my side to challenge my self on researching and figuring how to make it happen. I wanted a divider on the navigation bar, I also wanted the navbar to have social media icons instead of just the sin up and login links, my own choice of font from google fonts plus I wanted to a have border color for my thumbnails and then  finally I wanted to choose a different pallete than Colt used.  Here are some of the challenges I faced while and fortunately crossed over: 

1- First major challenge was trying to figure how to add a divider. This was huge and it took 2 days to figure it out. I googled and googled, tried lots of code, check with friends I trusted would know, tried alot of code but yet nothing. So how did I fix it? -- I decided to use a skill Colt taught us - the Chrome inspector!! I know I have said this earlier but again I love the chrome inspector!! This thing solved the challenge. I used the chrome inspector to check the code from a website that had the kind of divider i wanted to replicate. At first I couldn't understand the code so I took hours off and tried it again the next day. I played around with the chrome inspector trying to understand which part of the code creates the divider. As soon I found that out I just replicated their code and played with the copied code until it worked on mine. It wasn't a blind copy paste because I still edited properties to make it work on mine but eventually, it worked! 

2- Second challenge was trying to get my code work on CodePen! - I didn't know why none of my fancy pancy navbar wouldn't work or look how it did locally. I googled and found out that CodePen moved to Bootstrap 4 and my project was working with Bootstrap 3. Yup! After watching a video on how to change my settings to Bootstrap 3 and adding the Jquery plus JS links, everything appeared as it should. So now I know how to add external scripts to my CodePen projects. Yay! 

3- Another challenge was fixing the white space bug that appears when images are placed besides each other in grid system. I used the bootcamp forum to solve that. Also, solved the issue of having the images appear similarly cropped and in a more organized way because I had images with different width and heights.

These were my major challenges that took a while for me to solve besides the little ones that didn't take long to solve. 

This is a long thought, but I am so happy I was able to get over the challenges. I certainly didn't give up. Persistence is key, speaking of which I JUST HIT 30TH DAY OF 100 DAYS OF CODE with this very commit. I really hope to keep going. I am totally getting the hang of this challenge now. Let the learning continue! 


### Day 29  : 19th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** 99% done with the 'African Wildlife Image Gallery'. I am still looking for a way to add a divider to my navigation bar with the height of the divider shorter than the height of the items in the navigation bar. No breakthrough with that yet but I can say all the essentials of the photo blog are in placce. 

**Thoughts:** I am so sleepy I can barely type this update with both eyes open, I couldn't head to bed without logging for the day. I do hope I get a breakthrough with the last peice of the puzzle to my Photoblog. Next project is a start up landing page!


### Day 28  : 18th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** Worked on my 'African Wildlife Image Gallery' that I promised to create the other day. I am 80% done with it, I am left with adding the images and a color palette.

**Thoughts:** I was able to get the main parts of the photoblog ready in a jiff which put a smile on my face and boosted my confidence. What is taking me longer is the little extra mile I am going with the photo blog trying to add features based on google search. Right now I am stuck on creating a divider between two of my navigation items but facing challanges with the height of the divider. I have decided to take a break with it and continue the next day. Perhaps getting back to it with a fresh mind will do the trick. 

### Day 27   : 17th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** Had a code along session with Colt Steele building a photoblog. Tomorrow I will be building another photo blog but  completely on my own and using my own ideas and touches. 

**Thoughts:** Initially, I thought I would just attempt the photoblog on my own and then compare my solution to Colt's like I have been doing since I have started this bootcamp. I decided to code along with Colt this time because I felt I needed to learn how he attempts his projects from start - the process involved. I didn't regret doing so, I am glad I did because I learnt how to approach building this mini photoblog by  breaking down the requirements into simpler tasks and slowly building over it until I had a finish product. It was fun and I can't wait to attempt my own photoblog using my choice of color pallette, fonts, icons etc.     

### Day 26   : 16th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** Done with Colt Steele's Bootstrap tutorials. I will be consolidating what I have learnt for past days by building two projects - A photo blog using BS Grid System and a more challenging project - a start up landing page. 

**Thoughts:** My experience with last section's CSS hands on projects were fun (although it took a while to create but I am proud of what I was able to build) so I can't wait to start building these two projects using BS Grid System. My coding time was just an hour today, I had to sign up for my voters card and that took longer than I expected. Definitely glad I was able to finish the last two Bootstrap tutorials of this bootcamp. 

### Day 24 - 25   : 14th -15th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** watched some bootstrap  tutorials on Bootstrap Grid System. 

**Thoughts:** Today was ome of those days where netwwork isn't on my side. My tutorial vids kept buffering for so long . I tried to stay positive regardless. Grid system  looks alright now. I hope it staays that waay. I also hope tomorrow would be aa netter day for Airtel


### Day 23   : 13th Oct 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Rewatched yesterday's tutorial video and tried to do the exercises but because of family commitments, I could just manage two solid hours of working with it. 

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap is like playing with puzzles but you need to have an idea of what each of puzzle does so it fits in correctly (atleast that the way I see it now). I am giving myself another chance tomorrow before moving to next topic  - Bootstrap Grid System. I hope I finally get it while trying to attempt colt's code along by myself.  

### Day 22   : 12th Oct 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Continued with Colt Steele's web devp bootcamp - worked on Bootstrap forms and navbars.

**Thoughts:** It felt easier working with Bootstrap tutorials on FreeCodeCamp, I got a bit out of place with today's tutorial. I will give it some time to settle. Clearly, more practice with bootstrap is needed. 

### Day 21   : 11th Oct 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Continued with Colt Steele's Web Devp Bootcamp on Udemy - still on Bootstrap section. 

**Thoughts:** Airtel network was really bad today for video streaming so I just managed to watch few of the bootstrap tutorials. I hope it will be much better tomorrow. Can't wait to start applying Bootstrap on Colt's assignments. I've also started preparing a time table for studying Andela's Home study curriculum 

### Day 17 - 20  : 7th - 10th Oct 2017 
##### 
**Progress**: I didn't get the time to actually code anything, I was out of town w/o my laptop but I watched Colt Steele's Boostrap Tutorials videos and read coding posts on medium just to keep myself from zoning out of the coding atmosphere I have created. 

**Thoughts:** I missed tapping my fingers on my laptop. But I will be back on track soon 

### Day 12 - 16   : 3rd - 6th Oct 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Completed another CSS Box Model exercise, this time it was a mini news blogsite.  I have also started some introduction to Bootstrap framework.

**Thoughts:** The mini news blogsite was challenging but I didn't give up. It took couple of days but I think it looks good. The challenge gave me a good practice on using chrome inspector to figure out how to set the properties of my elements which would otherwise be so difficult. I love the chrome inspector!! 

**Link:** Here is how it looks on codepen: http://bit.ly/2wBweqv 

### Day 10 & 11   : 1st - 2nd Oct 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Completed another mini photo blog with my own touches using CSS Box Model 

**Thoughts:** I am finally building things. It feels good. So much more to learn!

**Link:** Here is how it looks on codepen: bit.ly/2xLzpzN 

### Day 7 - 9  : 28th - 30th Sept 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Continued learning CSS Box Model concepts on colt steel's bootcamp course , worked on Tic tac toe exercise and created a mini photo blog. 

**Thoughts:** Feeling good with CSS Box model concepts so far.  The tic tac toe and photo blog was fun. Next I will be creating  one on codepen with my own touches added to it.  

### Day 6  : 27th Sept 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Working with CSS Box Model.

**Thoughts:** I got a better understanding to how the CSS box model works. It was nice to see how chrome developer inspector can be used to understand the concept even better. I will be consolidating the concepts learnt today on my next session. 

### Day 5  : 26th Sept 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Worked on Colt Steele's CSS selector exercise to consolidate CSS specifcity.  

**Thoughts:** I did pretty well. Feels so good I didn't give up on any. I am actually excited to move on to the next topic. I still feel like coding but it's late. I need rest. haha

### Day  4 : 25th Sept 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Still on Colt Steele's web development bootcamp - Understanding CSS specificty and cascade. 

**Thoughts:** I didn't get much time today due to a friend's impromptu visit. I managed 30 mins of coding learning CSS specifity. Will be testing my self with a coding excercise tomorrow. 

### Day 3 : 24th Sept 2017
##### 
**Progress**: still on Colt Steele's web development bootcamp - worked with CSS selectors 

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 2 : 23rd Sept 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Worked some more with CSS 

**Thoughts:** Still slightly refreshing and learning new things on the go. Not much done today but hopefully tomorrow, I will be able to complete CSS section of the Bootcamp. 

### Day 1  : 22nd September 2017 
##### 
**Progress**: Worked on a form using HTML and CSS 

**Thoughts:** It feels good to not give up. I did something light today. I was running short of time but I managed to get soem refreshing going.
