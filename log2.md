### Day 28  : 18th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** Worked on my 'African Wildlife Image Gallery' that I promised to create the other day. I am 80% done with it, I am left with adding the images and a color palette.

**Thoughts:** I was able to get the main parts of the photoblog ready in a jiff which put a smile on my face and boosted my confidence. What is taking me longer is the little extra mile I am going with the photo blog trying to add features based on google search. Right now I am stuck on creating a divider between two of my navigation items but facing challanges with the height of the divider. I have decided to take a break with it and continue the next day. Perhaps getting back to it with a fresh mind will do the trick. 

### Day 27   : 17th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** Had a code along session with Colt Steele building a photoblog. Tomorrow I will be building another photo blog but  completely on my own and using my own ideas and touches. 

**Thoughts:** Initially, I thought I would just attempt the photoblog on my own and then compare my solution to Colt's like I have been doing since I have started this bootcamp. I decided to code along with Colt this time because I felt I needed to learn how he attempts his projects from start - the process involved. I didn't regret doing so, I am glad I did because I learnt how to approach building this mini photoblog by  breaking down the requirements into simpler tasks and slowly building over it until I had a finish product. It was fun and I can't wait to attempt my own photoblog using my choice of color pallette, fonts, icons etc.     

### Day 26   : 16th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** Done with Colt Steele's Bootstrap tutorials. I will be consolidating what I have learnt for past days by building two projects - A photo blog using BS Grid System and a more challenging project - a start up landing page. 

**Thoughts:** My experience with last section's CSS hands on projects were fun (although it took a while to create but I am proud of what I was able to build) so I can't wait to start building these two projects using BS Grid System. My coding time was just an hour today, I had to sign up for my voters card and that took longer than I expected. Definitely glad I was able to finish the last two Bootstrap tutorials of this bootcamp. 

### Day 24 - 25   : 14th -15th Oct 2017
##### 

**Progress** watched some bootstrap  tutorials on Bootstrap Grid System. 

**Thoughts:** Today was ome of those days where netwwork isn't on my side. My tutorial vids kept buffering for so long . I tried to stay positive regardless. Grid system  looks alright now. I hope it staays that waay. I also hope tomorrow would be aa netter day for Airtel


### Day 23   : 13th Oct 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Rewatched yesterday's tutorial video and tried to do the exercises but because of family commitments, I could just manage two solid hours of working with it. 

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap is like playing with puzzles but you need to have an idea of what each of puzzle does so it fits in correctly (atleast that the way I see it now). I am giving myself another chance tomorrow before moving to next topic  - Bootstrap Grid System. I hope I finally get it while trying to attempt colt's code along by myself.  

### Day 22   : 12th Oct 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Continued with Colt Steele's web devp bootcamp - worked on Bootstrap forms and navbars.

**Thoughts:** It felt easier working with Bootstrap tutorials on FreeCodeCamp, I got a bit out of place with today's tutorial. I will give it some time to settle. Clearly, more practice with bootstrap is needed. 

### Day 21   : 11th Oct 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Continued with Colt Steele's Web Devp Bootcamp on Udemy - still on Bootstrap section. 

**Thoughts:** Airtel network was really bad today for video streaming so I just managed to watch few of the bootstrap tutorials. I hope it will be much better tomorrow. Can't wait to start applying Bootstrap on Colt's assignments. I've also started preparing a time table for studying Andela's Home study curriculum 

### Day 17 - 20  : 7th - 10th Oct 2017 
##### 
**Progress**: I didn't get the time to actually code anything, I was out of town w/o my laptop but I watched Colt Steele's Boostrap Tutorials videos and read coding posts on medium just to keep myself from zoning out of the coding atmosphere I have created. 

**Thoughts:** I missed tapping my fingers on my laptop. But I will be back on track soon 

### Day 12 - 16   : 3rd - 6th Oct 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Completed another CSS Box Model exercise, this time it was a mini news blogsite.  I have also started some introduction to Bootstrap framework.

**Thoughts:** The mini news blogsite was challenging but I didn't give up. It took couple of days but I think it looks good. The challenge gave me a good practice on using chrome inspector to figure out how to set the properties of my elements which would otherwise be so difficult. I love the chrome inspector!! 

**Link:** Here is how it looks on codepen: http://bit.ly/2wBweqv 

### Day 10 & 11   : 1st - 2nd Oct 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Completed another mini photo blog with my own touches using CSS Box Model 

**Thoughts:** I am finally building things. It feels good. So much more to learn!

**Link:** Here is how it looks on codepen: bit.ly/2xLzpzN 

### Day 7 - 9  : 28th - 30th Sept 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Continued learning CSS Box Model concepts on colt steel's bootcamp course , worked on Tic tac toe exercise and created a mini photo blog. 

**Thoughts:** Feeling good with CSS Box model concepts so far.  The tic tac toe and photo blog was fun. Next I will be creating  one on codepen with my own touches added to it.  

### Day 6  : 27th Sept 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Working with CSS Box Model.

**Thoughts:** I got a better understanding to how the CSS box model works. It was nice to see how chrome developer inspector can be used to understand the concept even better. I will be consolidating the concepts learnt today on my next session. 

### Day 5  : 26th Sept 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Worked on Colt Steele's CSS selector exercise to consolidate CSS specifcity.  

**Thoughts:** I did pretty well. Feels so good I didn't give up on any. I am actually excited to move on to the next topic. I still feel like coding but it's late. I need rest. haha

### Day  4 : 25th Sept 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Still on Colt Steele's web development bootcamp - Understanding CSS specificty and cascade. 

**Thoughts:** I didn't get much time today due to a friend's impromptu visit. I managed 30 mins of coding learning CSS specifity. Will be testing my self with a coding excercise tomorrow. 

### Day 3 : 24th Sept 2017
##### 
**Progress**: still on Colt Steele's web development bootcamp - worked with CSS selectors 

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 2 : 23rd Sept 2017
##### 
**Progress**: Worked some more with CSS 

**Thoughts:** Still slightly refreshing and learning new things on the go. Not much done today but hopefully tomorrow, I will be able to complete CSS section of the Bootcamp. 

### Day 1  : 22nd September 2017 
##### 
**Progress**: Worked on a form using HTML and CSS 

**Thoughts:** It feels good to not give up. I did something light today. I was running short of time but I managed to get soem refreshing going.
