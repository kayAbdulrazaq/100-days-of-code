**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 10: July 8 , 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Forked 100DaysofCode repo on Github, Updated today's progress on it, Worked on FreeCodeCamp excercises.

**Thoughts:** I still have so much to learn on using Github and Git. So overwhelming but I can do this. FreeCodeCamp is going fine (so far I have learnt how to linking images, creating border for an image, creating forms, inputs and buttons for the forms,lists. I can see the cat photo app tutorial coming on fine. I can't wait to create my own version from scratch on codepen!
