##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 10: July 8 , 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Forked 100DaysofCode repo on Github, Updated today's progress on it, Worked on FreeCodeCamp excercises.

**Thoughts:** I still have so much to learn on using Github and Git. So overwhelming but I can do this. FreeCodeCamp is going fine (so far I have learnt how to linking images, creating border for an image, creating forms, inputs and buttons for the forms,lists. I can see the cat photo app tutorial coming on fine. I can't wait to create my own version from scratch on codepen!

### Day 11 : July 13  , 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: 1) Finally completed Problem set 3 (optional) on Udacity's Intro to Comp Science (Python). 
2) Also, a lot of progress with FreeCodeCamp 's challenges. Here is a quick list on what I coverd in today's challenges: 
-> Working with Divs
-> Using ID attributes + Styling ID attributes 
-> Learnt how to customize padding, margin and  border of an element 
-> CSS Inheritance & Overiding CSS elements + ID precedency in CSS Styling. 


**Thoughts:** I feel really good today. I had a lot of tasks to chew on today (including non coding related) and I made sure I worked on some coding first and eventually got the non coding tasks done as well. Feeling accomplished!!
